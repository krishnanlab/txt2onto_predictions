# Lucas_Gillenwater_Disease_Predictions

This folder contains various predictions generated by **txt2onto** to identify public RNA-seq studies related to the **requested diseases** provided by Lucas Gillenwater. The results are summarized in the attached file, `disease_predictions_with_descriptions.csv`.

## File Overview

Below is a brief explanation of the key columns in the file:

- **Disease ID**: The MONDO ontology identifier for each disease.
- **Disease Name**: The specific name of the disease.
- **Study ID**: The unique identifier for each RNA-seq study sourced from refine.bio.
- **prob**: The predicted probability that the study is associated with the disease.
- **log2(prob/prior)**: A log-transformed measure of how much more (or less) likely the study is to be associated with the disease compared to random chance, providing a quick measure of prediction reliability. A value greater than 1 suggests a strong association with the disease. A value of 1 or less indicates weaker associations.
- **Study Description**: A brief summary of the study and its focus.

**Note:** Only RNA-seq studies with a log2(prob/prior) value greater than 1 have been included in the attached file. The data is also sorted in descending order of log2(prob/prior) to prioritize the studies with the strongest predictions.
